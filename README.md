# Weather App

## Introduction

The **Weather App** is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Dart that provides real-time weather information for any location. Users can search for weather details by city name, get current weather conditions, and view a 7-day forecast.

The primary goal of this project is to offer an easy-to-use interface for checking weather updates and forecasts quickly and efficiently.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Updates:** Get current weather details including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **7-Day Forecast:** View weather predictions for the next 7 days.
- **Search by City:** Find weather information by entering a city name.
- **Location Services:** Automatically fetch weather data for the user's current location.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Responsive design with smooth navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** The UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile.
- **Dart:** The programming language for developing the application.
- **HTTP:** For API requests to fetch weather data.
- **Provider:** State management solution in Flutter.
- **Geolocator:** For accessing device location services.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Provides weather data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.0 or above)
- Android Studio or Xcode (for iOS)
- OpenWeatherMap API key (sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/))

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
    cd weather-app
    ```

2. **Install Flutter SDK:**
    Follow the instructions on the [official Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install the Flutter SDK.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. **Set Up API Key:**
    - Create a file named `api_keys.dart` in the `lib/` directory.
    - Add your OpenWeatherMap API key in the following format:
      ```dart
      const String openWeatherMapApiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
      ```

5. **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Usage

1. **Search for Weather:**
   Enter a city name in the search bar to get weather updates for that location.

2. **View Current Weather:**
   See the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

3. **Check Forecast:**
   View the weather forecast for the next 7 days to plan ahead.

4. **Use Location Services:**
   Allow the app to access your device's location to fetch weather data for your current location.

## API Integration

1. **Weather Data:**
   The app fetches weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Ensure you have an API key and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with your actual key in the `api_keys.dart` file.

2. **Geolocation:**
   The app uses the `geolocator` package to access the device's current location for weather updates.
